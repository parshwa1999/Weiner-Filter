Weiner Filter

The inverse filtering approach presented earlier was "ad hoc"
in the choise of . Wiener filtering is more objective and
incorporates the characteristics of noise and the degradation
function in the restoration process.
Assumption: Image and noise are considered as random
variables.
Aim is to find an estimate Ë†f(x, y) of the uncorrupted image
f(x, y) such that the mean square error between the two is
minimum.
